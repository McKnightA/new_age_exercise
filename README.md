# new_age_exercise

todo:
- add more exercises
- make routines a thing

app opens to list of routines (maybe personal/community favorites)
select one and it opens to a list of exercises with sets and reps or durations for each
select an exercise and it shows an animation of the reference exercise in 3d form
click a ready button and it swaps the animation out for a live stream with an overlay of the pose estimation
it counts the reps aloud(toggleable)
once all reps are complete or the set is ended by the user, the original reference 3d form returns
the user's 3d form appears next to or overlapped with the reference
if the routine's rep count is met, the set count drops by one for that exercise

be able to create a new routine or exercise
be able to share new exercises and routines with the community

potentially be able to add a figure to the 3d skeleton animation
get personalization options for the figure as rewards for completing routines
buy different avatar coaches like goku, rocky balboa, danny davito, etc to represent the reference exercises
